# CongestionControlAlgorithms
Implementing some of Congestion Control algorithms, 4th CA of The Computer Networks course @ University of Tehran, spring 2023

# Introduction
In this assignment, we would implement 3 Congestion Control algorithms: `Reno`, `New Reno` and `BBR`.

# Questions

## 1. Difference between congestion control and flow control
congestion control and flow control are both important mechanisms for ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably over computer networks. Congestion control prevents too much data from being injected into the network, while flow control prevents senders from overrunning the capacity of receivers.

- congestion control: it is the process of preventing too much data from being injected into the network, which can cause switches or links to become overloaded and lead to network congestion. Congestion can occur when there is more traffic on the network than it can handle, which can result in slower data transfer rates, dropped packets, and other issues. Congestion control mechanisms are designed to prevent this from happening by regulating the amount of data that is sent into the network.
- flow control: it is the process of preventing senders from overrunning the capacity of receivers. This is important because if a sender sends data too quickly, the receiver may not be able to process it all, which can result in dropped packets and other issues. Flow control mechanisms are designed to prevent this from happening by regulating the rate at which data is sent from the sender to the receiver.
